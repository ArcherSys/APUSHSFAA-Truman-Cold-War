# Labor Unions in The South

Question 2: Explain Why Labor Unions were not as successful in the South following the war


The Republicans were agitated at the amount of power FDR gave to labor unions under the New Deal (wagner Act), so they sought to place limitations on their power with the Taft Hartley Act, in which:


1.) outlawed the closed shop (all union),

2.) made unions liable for damages that resulted from labor disputes

and

3.)Mandated that all union members had to take an anti-communist oath
